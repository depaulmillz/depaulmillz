I am a software performance engineer at NVIDIA where I work on deep learning library performance. 
Before joining NVIDIA, I did my PhD at Lehigh University in the [Scalable Systems and Software Research Group](http://sss.cse.lehigh.edu/) where I focused on heterogeneous systems and data repositories.
I did a mixture of work on concurrency, parallelism, heterogeneous and distributed data structures, and data repositories and utilized GPUs and RDMA to ensure these approaches achieved high-performance.

My interests are generally in making software fast through GPU computation, and ensuring that others can take advantage of this hardware.
